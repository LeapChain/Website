# APIs for LeapChain

This folder currently hosts all the api endpoints for the leap chain apis. The existing `src/apis` folder hosts the previous TNBC apis.

## Future Refactoring

When we are sure that we no longer need the TNBC apis, we can remove the `src/apis` folder and rename `src/apisV2` to `src/apis`.
